ingredients: "## Pumpkin and spinach lasagne


  _Serves 6-8_


  *   1 kg x crown pumpkin, skinned and sliced into 1-cm thick slices (note: butternut pumpkin is only allowed in minimal amounts, so choose crown instead. You could also substitute the pumpkin for eggplant)

  *   ¼ cup x olive oil

  *   1 TBSP x cumin seeds

  *   ½ TBSP x paprika

  *   small bunch of fresh thyme

  *   sea salt and pepper, to season

  *   1 x lemon, juiced

  *   1 x 200-g pack gluten-free dried lasagne sheets

  *   200 g x feta

  *   300 g x lactose-free, unsweetened plain yoghurt

  *   100 g x baby spinach or silverbeet, washed and dried

  *   2 cups x pureed fresh tomatoes (or the equivalent of jarred tomatoes)

  *   ½ cup x raw walnuts, finely chopped

  *   ½ cup x grated parmesan (find a vegetarian version if you want a completely veggie meal)"
instructions: "Pre-heat the oven to 200°C.


  Toss the pumpkin slices with the olive oil, cumin seeds, paprika and thyme until the pumpkin is well coated. Season with ground sea salt and fresh cracked pepper and transfer to a large roasting tray.


  Roast the pumpkin in the hot oven for 15 minutes until soft and golden.


  Transfer the roasted pumpkin and all the pan juices to a shallow bowl and drizzle over the lemon juice. Place in the fridge to marinate for at least 30 minutes.


  When you are ready to assemble the lasagne cook the pasta sheets in batches in plenty or rapidly boiling water until al-dente (tender) but not overcooked. Crumble the feta into the yoghurt and combine.


  Turn down the oven to 180°C.


  In a deep pie or lasagne dish spoon in a layer of the feta/yoghurt mix, top with a layer of baby spinach/silverbeet and then a layer of the roasted pumpkin. Top with cooked lasagne sheets.


  Top with a couple of spoonfuls of the pureed tomatoes, more feta/yoghurt, baby spinach/silverbeet and pumpkin. Top with another layer of cooked pasta and repeat. Finish by sprinkling the walnuts and parmesan on top, and place in the oven to cook for 35-40 minutes until bubbling and golden on top.


  Remove from the oven and allow to cool for a few minutes before cutting into wedges. Serve accompanied with a crisp salad or a side of low-FODMAP vegetables if you prefer."

Back in 2012, I featured a recipe for low-FODMAP vegetarian lasagne, adapted from [this](http://veggienumnum.com/2011/07/15/pumpkin-spinach-lasagna/) recipe from one of my [favourite food blogs](http://veggienumnum.com/). When I transitioned from a Tumblr blog to this new redesign I couldn't automatically bring all the content with me (reminder: it can still be found [here](http://cookingwithnothing.tumblr.com/), though).

While adding new recipes along the way, I figured I'd transfer over my favourites in due course. But it seems some readers had favourites of their own. I received a few e-mails from followers requesting this lasagne (shout outs to Astrid and Ann), which I've finally managed to reshoot and post here. Enjoy!
