I practise yoga almost every morning, meaning I'm pretty ravenous when I get home for breakfast. I'll often soak some oats the night before for bircher, but when I need to change things up – or if I’ve forgotten to prepare things in advance – I sometimes throw together this quick muesli. To do so, I make sure I always have the dry ingredients in my pantry and some kind of milk or yoghurt (low-FODMAP if necessary) on hand. A serving of fruit is great, too (cooked is easier to digest). The muesli also makes a great topping for any of my smoothie bowl recipes.

If you want variation, just switch the type of nuts and seeds you use – or team the muesli with a different fruit (again, low-FODMAP if necessary).
