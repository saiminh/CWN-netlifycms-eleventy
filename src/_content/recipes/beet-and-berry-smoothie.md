  ## Sweet choco-beet smoothie 


  *Serves one*


  * 1 x small-medium beetroot, freshly cooked and allowed to cool slightly, then peeled 

  * 1 cup x coconut milk or 1/2 cup each of coconut yoghurt and water

  * 1 TBSP carob (to reduce the stimulants and/or keep it hypoallergenic) or raw cacao

  * 1 TBSP x almond butter

  * 1 tsp x extra virgin olive oil 

  * 1 tsp x vanilla extract 

  * 1 tsp x raw honey 

  * Optional add-ins: freshly ground flaxseed or chia seeds (these will both thicken the smoothie so extra water might be necessary, depending on your desired thickness), maca powder
instructions: Add smoothie ingredients to a blender (or use a stick/staff
  blender). Blend until smooth, adding extra coconut milk or water to achieve
  desired consistency.

I love the combination of beetroot and chocolate: the basis of one of my [favourite cakes](https://www.houseandgarden.co.uk/recipe/flour-free-chocolate-beetroot-cake), by Amber Rose. I cook the beetroot to make it easier to digest (and to help make the smoothie a bit creamier), but feel free to go raw if that’s your thing (and only in the warmer months). 

Feel like a smoothie bowl instead? Use a full cup of coconut yoghurt without thinning it with water, then top with your favourite goodies: cacao nibs (unsuitable for the hypoallergenic diet), coconut, puffed quinoa, buckwheat flakes, pomegranate seeds, toasted and chopped almonds . . .
