  ##Choco mint smoothie


\"
 	* 1 cup x milk substitute of choice*
 	* 1/8 x avocado**
 	* 1 x frozen banana
 	* Handful x spinach leaves
 	* 6 x mint leaves
 	* A few drops x peppermint extract
 	* 1/2 tsp x spirulina powder
 	* 1 TBSP x raw cacao nibs

ingredients: >-
  Combine all ingredients except the cacao nibs in a blender and pulse until smooth. Stir the cacao nibs through (and garnish with a few extra if you like).

* those on a low-FODMAP diet are safe with lactose-free, hemp, macadamia, rice, quinoa or almond milk (be sure to check for high-FODMAP additives such as inulin). I usually alternate between almond milk and coconut milk.

** if not on a low-FODMAP diet, feel free to increase this amount. You’ll get a creamier result.

I’ve probably talked about my love of peppermint choc chip ice cream on this blog before, but obviously making a diet-friendly version takes time. This little gem, however, is a breeze to blend up. It’s not quite the same as the real deal, but it’s still damn good.
