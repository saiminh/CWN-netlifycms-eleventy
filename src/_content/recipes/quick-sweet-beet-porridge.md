A﻿ while ago I published a recipe for [Sweet Beet and Rose Porridge](https://www.cookingwithnothing.com/sweet-beet-and-rose-porridge/). Even though it doesn’t take a tonne of time, this version is a lot quicker and removes the hassle of grating the beetroot. It also uses up the beetroot powder I once bought, inspired by the pink latte idea only to find I didn’t really fancy it as a coffee replacement. Sigh. Now, I find myself turning to this recipe more often than the original – until my beetroot powder runs out, at least.
