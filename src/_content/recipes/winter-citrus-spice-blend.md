  ## Winter citrus spice blend


  *   Peels from 2 x medium oranges or 3 x mandarins*

  *   2 tsp x ground cinnamon

  *   1 tsp x ground cloves

  *   1 tsp x dried rosemary


  *I dry them on the windowsill for a day or two until crunchy, then crush in a spice grinder. If you want to speed things up, you can cook the peels for an hour or two at 100°c until curling at the edges, then dry completely before grinding.
instructions: Combine everything in a spice grinder and blitz until you have a
  fine powder. Store in a sealed jar.

In a bid to create less waste, I’ve been drying my citrus peels on the windowsill then grinding them in a spice grinder to create zest. This recipe is my favourite way to use up orange or mandarin peels: it’s a wintry yet energizing addition to my morning bowl of porridge. You could also use it in granola, cookies or cakes – or even in savoury dishes like soups and couscous salads.
