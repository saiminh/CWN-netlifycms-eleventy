I love aloo gobi (an Indian potato-and-cauliflower dish) but always find it a bit fiddly to make. Cooking all the vegetables separately: fry, remove, repeat. Iâ€™m more of a one-pot-wonder kinda girl. What if, I thought, I could translate that tasty Indian concoction into a bowl of soup? Well, I think this comes pretty damn close. The methi (dried fenugreek leaves) and nigella seeds are really important for an authentic flavour. I found both at an Asian supermarket.
