Raita is perfect for dolloping over a curry or Middle Eastern dish, or using as a dip with your favourite veggie sticks.

Either use some [homemade probiotic yoghurt](https://cookingwithnothing.com/probiotic-yoghurt/) for this recipe or, if you've none to hand, grab a pot of pre-made yoghurt from your local store. Choose an organic one with no added sugar, fillers or weird things. Just yoghurt, with as many different beneficial bacteria strains as possible. Reading ‘contains live bacteria’ on a packet doesn’t convince me; I go for the longest list of Greek names: lactobacillus bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium and the like.
