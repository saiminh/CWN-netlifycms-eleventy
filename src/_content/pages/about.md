# About me

**I’m a New Zealander living in Amsterdam who absolutely loves food but grew up with a tonne of tummy problems. For years they were put down to the ol’ IBS, and anyone who’s been given this diagnosis will understand it’s more than a little frustrating.**

I turned down one doctor’s offer of medication, as I was unwilling to treat the symptoms but not the cause, and ignored a dietician who told me I’ll ‘grow out of it’. I followed a low-FODMAP diet for years, which helped to manage my symptoms but not to overcome them. It wasn’t until I met a Naturopathic Doctor and learned that I suffer from gut dysbiosis, a near complete lack of beneficial intestinal flora, that my gut-healing journey could truly begin.

And a journey it has been. It’s taken years of patience, discipline and struggle – and this blog is an outlet for that struggle. The erraticness of the site corresponds to my food history. One day I was eating something, the next day not (ask my friends who needed an updated list if they ever wanted to cook for me). I’ve been on countless elimination diets – some days I really did feel like I was ‘cooking with nothing’, with only a handful of foods on my allowed list. You’ll see some low-FODMAP recipes, for instance, even though it’s a diet to which I no longer prescribe. I do know that the regime has helped many people, though, and I was always eager to find new recipes while I was following it.

Nowadays, ‘cooking with nothing’ has come to mean something else. It’s about cooking with nothing <em>that doesn’t serve me</em>. After years of having to learn what’s seemingly <em>wrong</em> about a certain food, I can now focus on what’s <em>right</em> about it. As my gut has stabilized, I’ve moved towards a way of eating that’s whole food-oriented, seasonal, largely vegetarian and filled with fermented foods that feed good bacteria in the gut. This way, I can try to make sure my improved gut health stays that way.

While my main goal is to help others suffering from similar circumstances – but please remember, this is just <em>my</em> experience and yours may be completely different; do find a health professional to guide you on your journey – I hope that even those with impeccable digestion will enjoy the food to be found here.

Here’s to gut health!
