ingredients: |-
  * 1 TBSP x ghee (or coconut oil to make it vegan) 
  * 1 x small or ½ large x beetroot, grated (around ½ cup)
  * ¼ cup x oats 
  * 30 g x coconut cream + ¾ cup water (or equivalent of coconut milk)
  * 2 x cardamom pods
  * Handful of sultanas 
  * 1 TBSP x maple syrup 
  * 1 tsp x rose water
  * Handful of toasted almonds or drizzle of almond butter, to serve 
  * Drizzle of coconut cream or coconut yoghurt, to serve
  * Sprinkling of cacao nibs, to serve
instructions: >-
  In a small-medium pot or cast-iron skillet, sauté the ghee and grated beetroot
  over a low-medium heat for 5 mins, stirring occasionally. 


  Crack the cardamom pods open with your teeth while keeping them intact. Add them to the pan along with the coconut cream and water (or equivalent of coconut milk) and sultanas. Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down to low and cook for 15 mins, stirring occasionally. 


  Add the oats, along with another ¼ cup of water if the mixture is starting to dry out. Bring everything back to boil, then lower the temperature to low-medium. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally to make sure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pan. Add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if the mixture starts to look too dry. You're going for a thick, creamy porridge. 


  Add the maple syrup and rosewater, then stir to combine. 


  Remove from the heat and taste, adding more sweetener or rosewater if necessary. 


  Top with coconut cream or coconut yoghurt, toasted almonds or almond butter, and cacao nibs, and serve immediately.
