  _Makes one large portion_

  *   1/2-1 cup x coconut milk, depending on your thickness preference

  *   2 tsp x carob (to keep it hypoallergenic) or raw cacao

  *   1 TBSP x almond butter

  *   1/2 tsp x cinnamon powder

instructions: "Add smoothie ingredients to a blender (or use a stick blender). Blend until smooth, adding extra milk or water if necessary to achieve desired consistency."

I like the beetroot-berry combo: two purple foods that taste great together. Plus, adding beetroot sneaks a vegetable into what would otherwise be a fruit-filled smoothie, increasing fibre and nutrition. I cook the beetroot to make it easier to digest (and to help make the smoothie a bit creamier), but feel free to go raw if that’s your thing. See my [beetroot and raspberry soaked oats](https://cookingwithnothing.com/beetroot-and-raspberry-soaked-oats/) for another spin on the pairing.

Feel like a smoothie bowl instead? Use (coconut) yoghurt instead of milk, then top with your favourite goodies: cacao nibs (unsuitable for the hypoallergenic diet), coconut, puffed quinoa, buckwheat flakes, fresh berries, pomegranate seeds, toasted and chopped almonds . . .
