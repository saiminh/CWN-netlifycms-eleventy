  ## Beet and berry smoothie


  *Makes one large portion*


  * 1 x small-medium cooked beetroot
  
  * 1 cup x berries (I used half blackberries and half raspberries here)
  
  * 1/2-1 cup x coconut milk, depending on your thickness preference
  
  * 2 tsp x carob (to keep it hypoallergenic) or raw cacao
  
  * 1 TBSP x almond butter
  
  * 1/2 tsp x cinnamon powder
  
  * Optional add-ins: freshly ground flaxseed, chia seeds, maca powder

instructions: >-
  Add smoothie ingredients to a blender (or use a stick blender). Blend until smooth, adding extra milk or water if necessary to achieve desired consistency.

I like the beetroot-berry combo: two purple foods that taste great together. Plus, adding beetroot sneaks a vegetable into what would otherwise be a fruit-filled smoothie, increasing fibre and nutrition. I cook the beetroot to make it easier to digest (and to help make the smoothie a bit creamier), but feel free to go raw if that’s your thing. See my [beetroot and raspberry soaked oats](https://cookingwithnothing.com/beetroot-and-raspberry-soaked-oats/) for another spin on the pairing.

Feel like a smoothie bowl instead? Use (coconut) yoghurt instead of milk, then top with your favourite goodies: cacao nibs (unsuitable for the hypoallergenic diet), coconut, puffed quinoa, buckwheat flakes, fresh berries, pomegranate seeds, toasted and chopped almonds . . .
