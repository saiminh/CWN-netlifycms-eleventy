ingredients: "## Mexican-inpsired veggie soup


  _Serves 4_


  *   1 TBSP x flavourless coconut oil

  *   1 x red onion, diced

  *   2 tsp x ground cumin

  *   1 tsp x dried oregano

  *   1 tsp x smoked paprika

  *   1 tsp x dried chipotle flakes

  *   1-2 fresh jalapenos, chopped (remove the seeds if they’re too spicy for your taste)

  *   2 x garlic cloves, crushed

  *   1 x zucchini, sliced in four lengthways then chopped into 1-cm slices

  *   1 cup x red wine

  *   2 cups x vegetable stock

  *   400 g x whole or diced peeled tomatoes

  *   350 g x jar sweetcorn kernels, rinsed and drained

  *   400 g x cooked black beans

  *   20 g x dark chocolate (80% cocoa or above)

  *   Salt and pepper, to taste


  _To serve_


  *   A dollop of full-fat yoghurt (vegans or dairy-free folk could use guacamole instead)

  *   Fresh coriander leaves

  *   Juice of half a lime per person"
instructions: "In a large pot, melt the coconut oil over a medium heat. Add the onion and cook for a few minutes until it starts to soften.


  Add the spices, jalapenos and garlic, and cook, stirring for a further few minutes until fragrant. Add the zucchini to the pot and cook, stirring to cover in the spices.


  Pour in the red wine and stir, making sure it collects any spices from the bottom of the pot. Add the stock and tomatoes and stir to combine. Turn the heat to low, cover and cook for around 20 minutes, or until the zucchini is cooked to your liking.


  Add the sweetcorn, black beans and chocolate, stir, and cook for a further 5 minutes to warm through.


  Season with salt and pepper, then serve the soup with a dollop of yoghurt or guacamole on top, a sprinkling of fresh coriander leaves and a good squeeze of fresh lime juice."

I've never been to Mexico – it didn’t really sound like a good place for someone with a dodgy gut – but man do I love the flavours in Mexican food. I know what you find in Europe is more Tex-Mex, less authentic but my boyfriend, who _has_ travelled to the country in question, said this soup reminded him of what he ate there. Perhaps he’ll say otherwise once we visit together – now that my dodgy gut is becoming a thing of the past. But for now, I’ll take it as a compliment.
