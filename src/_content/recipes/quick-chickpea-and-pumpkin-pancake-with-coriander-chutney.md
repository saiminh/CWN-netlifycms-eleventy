  *Serves 1*


  ## Chickpea and pumpkin pancake 


  * 75g x chickpea flour 

  * 115ml x plant-based milk of choice (I use almond) 

  * 100g x butternut squash, peeled and grated 

  * 1 TBSP x ghee (or coconut oil, to make it vegan) 

  * 1 x spring onion, sliced 

  * 1/2 tsp each x cumin seeds, coriander seeds, fennel seeds and ground turmeric 

  * Salt and pepper, to season 


  ## Coriander chutney 


  * 1/2 bunch x coriander, including stems

  * 1-2 TBSP x lime juice 

  * 1/4 cup x water

  * 1/2 cup x desiccated coconut 

  * 1 cm x fresh ginger, peeled 

  * 1 tsp x raw honey 

  * 1/4 tsp x salt
instructions: >-
  Add the chickpea flour to a medium bowl and season with salt and pepper. Pour
  in the milk and whisk until smooth. Leave the mixture for 5 minutes, while you
  prepare the chutney. 


  Add the coriander, lime juice and water to a high-speed blender or food processor and blend until the coriander stalks have shred into smaller pieces. You might have to scrape the sides of the blender/processor a few times as you go. Add the remaining ingredients and blend into a paste, again scraping down the sides a few times along the way. Add some more water if the chutney is too dry and crumbly. (Whatever chutney you don’t use for this dish can be stored in a sealed jar in the fridge for up to 3 days.)


  Heat the ghee/oil in a small frying pan (mine has a base cooking surface of around 19 cm) over a medium heat. Cook the spring onion until soft, then add the spices and cook for a few minutes until lightly toasted and fragrant. 


  Add the grated butternut squash/pumpkin to the chickpea batter, followed by the mixture of oil, onion and spices. Stir until combined. 


  Add a knob more ghee/oil to the same pan if needed, then pour in the batter, smoothing it down with a wooden spoon as you go. Cook over a medium heat for 5 minutes, until the sides are browning and the top of the mixture is starting to set. Lower the heat if the bottom surface is browning too quickly and the top hasn’t yet set.


  Carefully flip the pancake (it can help to flip the pancake onto a plate first and then slide it back into the pan if your pancake is larger) and cook for a further 5 minutes on the other side. 


  Slide the cooked pancake onto a plate and top with chutney to serve.

This recipe makes a great working-from-home lunch or quick dinner – especially if you have the chutney already on hand. The pumpkin can be replaced with any root veggie of choice, and the dish can easily be made vegan too.
