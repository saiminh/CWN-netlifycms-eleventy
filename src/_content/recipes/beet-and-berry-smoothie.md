  ## Sweet choco-beet smoothie


  *Serves one*


  * 1 x small-medium beetroot, freshly cooked and allowed to cool slightly, then peeled 

  * 1 cup x coconut milk or 1/2 cup each of coconut yoghurt and water

  * 1 TBSP x carob (to reduce the stimulants and/or keep it hypoallergenic) or raw cacao

  * 1 TBSP x almond butter

  * 1 tsp x extra virgin olive oil 

  * 1 tsp x vanilla extract 

  * 1 tsp x raw honey 

  * Optional add-ins: freshly ground flaxseed or chia seeds (these will both thicken the smoothie so extra water might be necessary, depending on your desired thickness), maca powder
instructions: >-
  Add smoothie ingredients (except the honey) to a blender (or use a stick/staff
  blender). 


  Blend until smooth, adding extra coconut milk or water to achieve desired consistency.


  The smoothie should now be around room temperature, even if your beetroot was warm to begin with. If not, wait until it is before adding the honey, which shouldn’t be heated. When ready, add the honey, blend again, then serve.

I love the combination of beetroot and chocolate: the basis of one of my [favourite cakes](https://www.houseandgarden.co.uk/recipe/flour-free-chocolate-beetroot-cake), by Amber Rose. 

Here, I cook the beetroot to make it easier to digest (and to help make the smoothie a bit creamier), but feel free to go raw if that’s your thing (and only in the warmer months). 

Beetroot is also great for menstruating individuals during that time of the month. It’s also a time we often turn to chocolate for comfort (and magnesium), so a dose of raw cacao can satisfy the craving without the processed sugar. 

Feel like a smoothie bowl instead? Use coconut cream or a full cup of coconut yoghurt without thinning it with water, then top with your favourite goodies: cacao nibs (unsuitable for the hypoallergenic diet), coconut, puffed quinoa, buckwheat flakes, pomegranate seeds, toasted and chopped almonds . . .
