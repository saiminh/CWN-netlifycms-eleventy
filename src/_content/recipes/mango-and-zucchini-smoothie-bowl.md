  ## Mango and zucchini smoothie bowl


  *Serves 1*


  * 30g x dried mango pieces, plus a few extra slices to garnish if you like

instructions: >-
  Soak the mango pieces in warm water until soft. 


  Drain the soaked mango, reserving the water. If using extra mango to garnish, set a few soaked slices aside and add the rest to a blender (or blending vessel if using a stick blender). 


  Add the remaining smoothie ingredients and any optional add-ins to the blender. Blend until smooth but thick, adding a small amount of the reserved soaking water* if necessary to achieve desired consistency. Sprinkle over any toppings and serve.


  \*Any remaining soaking water can be added to dhals for some sweetness, or sipped as a sweet beverage.

description: Creamy and subtle, zucchini makes a great base for this summery
  sneaky veggie smoothie.

Subtle enough to hide behind whatever fruit you use and creamier than spinach, zucchini makes a great base for a sneaky veggie smoothie. Stick to the summer months for this one, when your gut can better handle raw vegetables. I used to have this recipe on the website using raw zucchini *and* raw mango, but after working with an Ayurvedic doctor I no longer mix fruit and vegetables in one meal (it's not great for digestion), so the workaround is to use dried mango instead. 

In keeping with the tropical taste of mango, I use coconut yoghurt here, but feel free to substitute for dairy yoghurt or your favourite non-dairy alternative. This can be turned into a more drinkable/less spoonable smoothie by using coconut milk instead of yoghurt.
