ingredients: "## Low-FODMAP Mee Goreng


  _Serves two_


  *   2 TBSP x coconut oil

  *   2 x organic free-range eggs, lightly beaten

  *   100g x haricot vert green beans, trimmed and cut in half on an angle

  *   100g x bok choy (leaves and stalks), roughly chopped

  *   300g x brown rice noodles, cooked and drained

  *   1 ½ tsp x ground coriander

  *   1 tsp x ground cumin

  *   ¼ tsp x white pepper

  *   2 x red chillies, finely chopped (use more or less, depending on your heat preference)

  *   4 TBSP x tamari

  *   50g x mung bean sprouts

  *   1 handful x firm lettuce (iceberg or little gem are good), roughly chopped

  *   2 x spring onions (green part only*), diced

  *   Juice of 1 x lemon

  *   Fresh coriander, to garnish"
instructions: "Place a wok over a high heat and add 1 x TBSP of the coconut oil. Once melted, add the eggs and cook until just set. I use a small frying pan and cook them into a thin omelette. Place to one side. Add the remaining oil and cook the haricot vert for a few minutes.


  Add the bok choy and cook until it wilts, then throw in the rice noodles. Spread the noodles in the wok using tongs or chopsticks – you want them to get a lot of heat, almost to fry. Mix gently, cooking the noodles for about two minutes.


  Now add the spices, chilli, tamari, bean sprouts and a tablespoon of cold water, and toss carefully. Cook for about a minute.


  Slice the cooked egg into thick strips and add it back to the pan to heat through.


  When ready to serve, transfer the noodles into bowls and top with shredded lettuce, spring onions and fresh coriander. Squeeze some lemon juice over the top and serve.


  _Note: Tofu is called for in the original recipe and is allowed on the standard low-FODMAP diet. I chose to use eggs instead as I tend to avoid non-fermented sources of soy. Read more about it [here](https://www.bewell.com/blog/the-soy-situation/)._


  *Don't throw away the white spring onion stalks! Sit them in some water on the window sill. The greens will grow back."

As a New Zealander now living in Europe, I miss Malaysian food for both its flavour and price. Granted this was many years ago, but we used to down bowlfuls of Mee Goreng (Malaysian stir-fried noodles) for just over a fiver – no more than a few euro. But knowing what I now know about food, I can admit that those weren’t the healthiest days of my life. And even a healthier version of Mee Goreng still contains FODMAPs such as onions, which can trigger IBS symptoms for some.

So here’s my low-FODMAP makeover, inspired by **[Yotam Ottolenghi’s version](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk%2Flifeandstyle%2F2008%2Fnov%2F01%2Fmee-goreng-yotam-ottolenghi&t=NDkwYmJlZDU2NGVlNzFiNGRlMjFiZDNlMjNkMWNkOGVkNzc2NTY5Zix6VDU0MlBsbw%3D%3D&b=t%3AVOYglxJ9sBHW8BFVroDfxQ&p=http%3A%2F%2Fcookingwithnothing.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F24618164282%2Fmee-goreng-low-fodmap&m=1)**, that’s a lot better for both you and your gut.
