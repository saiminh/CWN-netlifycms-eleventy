ingredients: "## No-grain nutty apple porridge


  _Serves 1_


  *   1 TSBP each x raw cashews, almonds and pecans (soaked in water with a pinch of salt overnight)

  *   4 TBSP x unsweetened apple puree

  *   1 tsp x cinnamon

  *   ½ tsp x ginger powder

  *   ¼ tsp x nutmeg

  *   ¼ tsp x ground cloves

  *   ¼ tsp x vanilla powder

  *   ½ cup x unsweetened dairy-free milk of choice (I'd suggest coconut if you're going all out on the grain-free thing)"
instructions: "Drain the pre-soaked nuts in a sieve and rinse until the water runs clear.


  Add the nuts to a food processor or blender with the remaining ingredients. Blend until smooth.


  Transfer to a pot and cook over a medium heat for 5-10 minutes, until the mixture thickens to your liking.

Here’s a warm and wintry spiced porridge made with nuts rather than oats. It’s filling, nutritious and delicious. This version uses apples, which are rich in prebiotics (these stimulate the growth of healthy microflora that populate your large intestine). You could easily swap them for sweet potato, carrot or pumpkin puree though. Banana is also an option, although I’m steering clear of them for the winter in a bid to [eat with the seasons](http://cookingwithnothing.com/post/133342667601/the-real-reason-im-eating-with-the-seasons).
